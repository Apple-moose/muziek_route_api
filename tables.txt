1-Association Tables (user_favorites and user_hates):

These tables handle the many-to-many relationship between User and Song. Each table has two columns:
user_id: References the id column in the users table.
song_id: References the id column in the songs table.

2-Song Model:

The favorited_by and hated_by relationships use the association tables to track which users have favorited or hated a song.
The back_populates keyword links this relationship to the User model.

3-User Model:

The favorite_songs and hated_songs relationships allow you to access the songs a user has favorited or hated through the association tables.
Query Example:

To add a favorite song for a user:

user.favorite_songs.append(song)
session.commit()

To retrieve users who favorited a song:

song.favorited_by
